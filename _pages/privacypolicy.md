# Privacy Policy

At Rituo, your privacy is our top priority. We believe your personal data and habits are private and should remain yours alone.

<br>

## 1.0 Your Data Belongs to You

**Rituo does not collect, store, or have access to any of your personal data.**

All your information—including tasks, habits, goals, statistics, and progress—is stored exclusively on your device and in your personal iCloud account.

<br>

## 2.0 What We Don't Do

- ❌ We don't collect your personal information
- ❌ We don't track your usage or behavior
- ❌ We don't share your data with third parties
- ❌ We don't use analytics or tracking tools
- ❌ We don't sell your data to advertisers
- ❌ We don't have access to your iCloud data

<br>

## 3.0 How Your Data is Stored

### 3.1 Local Storage
All your habit tracking data is stored locally on your device using SwiftData.

### 3.2 iCloud Sync
If you choose to enable iCloud sync, your data is encrypted and stored in your personal iCloud account using Apple's CloudKit framework. We never have access to this data—it's protected by your Apple ID and only you can access it.

### 3.3 Apple Watch
If you use Rituo on Apple Watch, your data syncs between your iPhone and Watch using Apple's Watch Connectivity framework. This data transfer happens directly between your devices and never passes through our servers.

<br>

## 4.0 AI Features

### 4.1 On-Device AI (Zoe)
Rituo includes an AI-powered coach called Zoe, which uses Apple's on-device Foundation Models (Apple Intelligence). All AI processing happens locally on your device—your habits, goals, and personal data are never sent to external servers.

### 4.2 Voice Input
If you use voice input to create tasks, speech recognition is processed on-device using Apple's Speech framework when possible. We never collect or store your voice recordings.

<br>

## 5.0 Third-Party Services

### 5.1 Apple Services
Rituo uses Apple's built-in frameworks:
- **CloudKit** for optional iCloud sync (encrypted in your personal iCloud)
- **Foundation Models** for on-device AI features (processed locally)
- **Speech Recognition** for voice task input (processed on-device)
- **Watch Connectivity** for Apple Watch sync (device-to-device only)
- **Live Activities** for task progress on Lock Screen (local only)

<br>

## 6.0 In-App Purchases

Rituo offers optional Premium features through Apple's In-App Purchase system. Payment processing is handled entirely by Apple—we never receive or store your payment information.

<br>

## 7.0 Notifications

Rituo may send you local notifications for task reminders. These notifications are scheduled and managed entirely on your device. We don't use push notifications from external servers.

<br>

## 8.0 Children's Privacy

Rituo does not knowingly collect any information from children under 13 years of age. Since we don't collect any personal information at all, the app is safe for all ages.

<br>

## 9.0 Changes to This Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Any changes will be posted on this page with an updated "Last updated" date.
